#############################   Code description   ############################


## This code shows an example on how to use the library defines a library 
## Probabilistic_Load_Profile_Generator to create a synthetic load profile 
## for electric power consumed byhouseholds, based on their probability of 
## being activated at a certain momemnt. In this case, the load profile is
## generated for six apartments and then is added to get the building's load
## profile.
## Created by: Joel Alp√≠zar Castillo.
