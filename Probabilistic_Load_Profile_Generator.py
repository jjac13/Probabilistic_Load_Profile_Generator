## The class HouseholdDevice allows to create a device. with its maximum power,
## hourly probability and load profile during the timestep. The class also
## contains several appliances as examples, with typical values.

## For the class HouseholdDevice, the description of the parameters is the 
## next:
##  Power: holds the maximum power for the device in kW.
##  HourlyProbability: (array) holds the probability for the device to be
##      activated at a certain hour.
##  TimestepProfile: (array) holds the load profile for the device, during the
##      chosen time step.
